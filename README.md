# ScrapingPyDogs
Scraping dogs information from *https://dogtime.com/* to save the data into a MySQL database. 
This is an experiment to improve my knowledge of Python and MySQL.

There are three main files:
- *main.py*
  - Scraping all the information of the dogs and export them to a csv and excel files;
- *dogs.sql*
  - Database creation file;
- *insert_into_db.py*
  - Get the csv file and save the information into MySQL database;
- *df_manipulation.py*
  - WIP --> The idea of this file is to calculate the mean of some dogs attributes;
